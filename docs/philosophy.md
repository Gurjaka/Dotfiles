# Philosophy Behind My Dotfiles 🧠💡🔥

These dotfiles aren’t just config files — they represent a **way of thinking** about computing, productivity, and flow. Here’s the core philosophy fueling every line and choice in this setup:

---

## 🎯 Minimalism & Purposeful Design 🧹✨

- **Less is more.**  
  I only include what’s absolutely necessary — no bloat, no unnecessary plugins or features. Every setting, script, and tool has a clear purpose. 🎯

- **Simplicity breeds maintainability.**  
  Clean, readable, and modular configs make it easier to update, debug, and understand my environment. 📜🔍

---

## 🚀 Speed & Efficiency ⚡⏱️

- **Fast startup, fast workflows.**  
  My environment loads quickly, and every keybind or command is designed to save time and reduce friction. 🏃‍♂️💨

- **Keyboard-centric control.**  
  I avoid mouse dependence whenever possible. Keyboard-driven workflows boost focus and speed. ⌨️🔥

---

## 🔄 Reproducibility & Portability 🌍📦

- **Infrastructure as code.**  
  Using Nix and Home Manager, my entire system is declarative and reproducible across machines. I can set up a new machine with a single command. 🤖🛠️

- **Version control everything.**  
  All configs live in Git, so changes are tracked, reversible, and sharable. 📚🔄

---

## 🛡️ Stability & Reliability 🧱🔒

- **Keep it solid.**  
  I favor stable, well-supported tools and avoid overly experimental features that could break my workflow. 🛠️✅

- **Automate repetitive tasks.**  
  Scripts and helpers reduce manual steps and errors. 🤖⚙️

---

## 🌱 Continuous Improvement 📈🔧

- **Always learning, always refining.**  
  My dotfiles evolve as I discover better tools, learn new techniques, and refine my workflow. 📚💡

- **Open-source mindset.**  
  Sharing and collaborating helps me grow and contributes to the community. 🤝🌐
