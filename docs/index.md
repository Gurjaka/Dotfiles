## ⚙️ System Overview 🖥️🔧

![qtile base](./assets/qtile_base.png) 

This setup is built to be **modern**, **efficient**, and **elegant**, with a focus on **keyboard-driven workflows** and **reproducible environments**:

- **Linux Kernel** 🐧  
  Powered by the [Zen kernel](https://github.com/zen-kernel/zen-kernel), optimized for _desktop responsiveness_, _gaming performance_, and _low latency_. It’s the core that keeps everything running **smooth and fast**.

- **Window Manager** 🪟🎛️  
  Using [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org) with an experimental Wayland backend. Qtile is a **dynamic tiling window manager written in Python**, designed for total keyboard control and customization. The Wayland backend delivers modern, secure, and smooth graphical performance.

- **Terminal Emulators** 🖱️⌨️  
  - [`Foot`](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot): A Wayland-native, minimal terminal emulator with great performance.  
  - [`Kitty`](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/): GPU-accelerated, feature-rich terminal for daily use.

- **Shells** 🐚  
  I primarily use [`Fish`](https://fishshell.com/) for its user-friendly features and smart completions, alongside [`Zsh`](https://www.zsh.org/) for compatibility and scripting power.

- **Notifier** 🔔  
  [`SwayNC`](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayNotificationCenter) handles notifications seamlessly within the Wayland ecosystem, keeping distractions minimal and information clear.

- **Editors** ✍️  
  - GUI: [`VSCode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for heavy lifting and GUI convenience.  
  - Terminal: [`Neovim`](https://neovim.io/) with custom plugin setups, LSP integration, and thematic consistency for an efficient terminal editing experience.

- **Git Helper** 🔄  
  [`Lazygit`](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) offers a fast, intuitive interface for managing Git workflows right in your terminal.

- **File Managers** 📁  
  - Terminal: [`Yazi`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/) for quick file navigation without leaving the keyboard.  
  - GUI: [`Thunar`](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start) for graphical file operations when needed.

- **System Monitor** 📊  
  [`Btop`](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop) provides an interactive and visually appealing resource monitor.

## 🎨 Theme & Philosophy 🎭🌈

This dotfiles collection is a harmonious blend of aesthetics and function:

> Visual style inspired by the ❄️ [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) theme’s icy calmness combined with the 🌲 [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) palette’s warm, organic tones — creating a balanced and visually comfortable workspace.

**Core values:**

- **Simplicity** 🧹  
  Every line of config has a purpose — no unnecessary fluff or bloat.

- **Speed** ⚡  
  Fast startup times, snappy interactions, and smooth workflows to keep you in the zone.

- **Maintainability** 🛡️  
  Modular, declarative, and reproducible with the power of Nix and Home Manager.

- **Wayland-first** 🚀  
  Embracing the future of Linux display protocols for improved security, performance, and flexibility.
