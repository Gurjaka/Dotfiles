# 🚀 Daily Usage — My Flow 💻🌙☕

Welcome to the cheat sheet of how I actually use my machine on a daily basis — optimized for **speed**, **clarity**, and **focus**. 🧠⚡

---

## 🖥️ Desktop Environment (Wayland + Qtile) 🎛️🌐

I use **Qtile Wayland** as my main compositor + WM — custom-built with my own config. I’ve decorated it with 🔷 **Nord theme**, powerline widgets, and intuitive keybindings.

### 📂 Workspace Usage

* `1` — **Code** 👨‍💻 (Neovim, Git)
* `2` — **Web** 🌍 (Firefox, Librewolf, Brave...)
* `3` — **Terminals** 🖥️ (htop, scripts, etc.)
* `4` — **Docs** 📚 (PDFs, notes, Zathura)
* `5+` — Scratch or task-specific

---

## 🧠 Workflow Habits

* Always boot into a clean state thanks to `nixos-rebuild` magic ✨
* I rarely reboot — my uptime is often 🗓️ multiple days
* I don’t close terminals — I live in them 🧘‍♂️
* No distractions — no YouTube, no games, just Vim & chill 🍃

---

## 🔧 Coding Flow

### 🥷 Editor: **Neovim**

* `nvim` with Lua config + custom plugin loadout 🔌
* LSPs + Treesitter = buttery smooth coding 🍰
* `telescope` to fuzzy-find everything 🧭
* `alpha-nvim` for startup dashboard 💫

### 📁 Project Management

* Git all the way 🧬
* `lazygit` for commits and merges ⚔️
* Nix flake-based repos for everything — no `pip`, no `npm`, no clutter ❄️

---

## 🖱️ Terminal Usage

* **Kitty** as my terminal — minimal, fast, and themed 💨🎨
* Scripts in `$HOME/.config/scripts/` do most of the grunt work 🤖
* Aliases displayed via `aliases` command for clarity 📜
* I don’t use tmux resurrect — I script my own recovery when needed 🧠

## 🧘‍♂️ Philosophy

> “I don’t chase minimalism. I **maintain** it.”

Everything I run is fast, lean, and distraction-free.
Nix handles the environment. I handle the flow. ⚙️💡
